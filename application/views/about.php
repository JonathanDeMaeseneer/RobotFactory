                        <h3>Cute household robots</h3>
                        <p>Umbrella Corp currently produces six robot models, each designated by a single letter. There are three lines of robots - household, butler and companion bots, in order of perceived value and increasing price. Models A through L have been reserved for household bots, M through V for butler bots, and W through Z for companion bots.</p>
                        <p>Robots come in three pieces - top (with head and manipulator appendages), torso (for essential fluids and computational components) and bottom (with propulsion mechanisms). Each piece has a two-letter designation - the bot model (a-z) and the part (1-3). You should grab the collection of parts pictures to use in your app</p>
                        <p>Each plant has an inventory of robot parts, specializes in making one piece for a designated robot model, and can ship unneeded parts or assembled robots to Umbrella's Panda Research Center, for credit.</p>
                        <p>Each robot piece, or assembled robot, has a Certificate of Authenticity (CA) code, issued by Umbrella Corp. When a plant buys parts from the research center, each comes with its own CA. When a plant sells parts or robots, they surrender the CA(s) for each of the pieces. Practically speaking, each CA will be a 6-8 hex digit code, which can be verified through head office.</p>
